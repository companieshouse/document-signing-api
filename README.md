# document-signing-api
API to sign documents digitally.

## MVP

* The MVP version of this API will be limited to digitally signing certified copies.

## Requirements
In order to build document-generator locally you will need the following:
- Java 11
- Maven
- Git

## Environment Variables

The supported environmental variables have been categorised by use case and are as follows.

### Deployment Variables
| Name                      | Description                                                  | Mandatory | Default | Example                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| AWS_REGION                | AWS region                                                   | √         | N/A     | `eu-west-2`            |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID         | Part of temporary AWS credentials.                           | √         | N/A     | `ASIA...`              |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY     | Part of temporary AWS credentials.                           | √         | N/A     | `UgO8...`              |
| AWS_SESSION_TOKEN         | Part of temporary AWS credentials.                           | √         | N/A     | `IQoJ...`              |
| SIGNED_DOC_BUCKET_NAME    | The name of the S3 bucket used for storing signed documents. | √         | N/A     | `document-signing-api` | 
| SIGNED_DOC_STORAGE_PREFIX | The prefix used for storing signed documents in S3.          | X         | N/A     | `cidev`                |

## Endpoints
| Path                           | Method | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *`/document-signing/sign-pdf`* | POST   | Signs an existing PDF document.                                     |
| *`/healthcheck`*               | GET    | Returns HTTP OK (`200`) to indicate a healthy application instance. |

## Docker
To create a certificate to sign the document the following can be done on the docker image:
```
1. $ docker exec -it document-signing-api bash
2. $ cd app/
3. $ keytool -genkey -alias <CERTIFICATE_ALIAS> -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 3650 -keystore keystore.jk
```

Once that has been done, update the docker compose file to contain the correct values for the following:
```
      - KEYSTORE_PATH=/app/keystore.jks
      - KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
      - CERTIFICATE_ALIAS=<CERTIFICATE_ALIAS>
```

The application should now be able to sign documents.

## Integration tests warning

* If you find any `testcontainers` based tests are hanging shortly after start up, this could be caused by start up 
checks. These can be disabled by setting this value in `~/.testcontainers.properties`:

```
checks.disable=true
```

Alternatively, when running such tests, set the corresponding environment variable:

```
export TESTCONTAINERS_CHECKS_DISABLE=true
```

Other, more manageable approaches, such as setting the same value in  `src/test/resources` do not seem to work.

The issue _may_ ultimately be caused by not having the `Use gRPC FUSE for file sharing` options checked in 
Docker Desktop General Preferences, but it may also not be convenient to have this checked either.
