# document-signing-api
API to sign documents digitally.

## MVP

* The MVP version of this API will be limited to digitally signing certified copies.

## Requirements
In order to build document-generator locally you will need the following:
- Java 11
- Maven
- Git

## Environment Variables

The supported environmental variables have been categorised by use case and are as follows.

### Deployment Variables
| Name                      | Description                                          | Mandatory | Default | Example     |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| AWS_REGION                | AWS region                                           | √         | N/A     | `eu-west-2` |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID         | Part of temporary AWS credentials.                   | √         | N/A     | `ASIA...`   |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY     | Part of temporary AWS credentials.                   | √         | N/A     | `UgO8...`   |
| AWS_SESSION_TOKEN         | Part of temporary AWS credentials.                   | √         | N/A     | `IQoJ...`   |
| SIGNED_DOC_STORAGE_PREFIX | The prefix used for storing signed documents in S3.  | X         | N/A     | `cidev`     |

## Endpoints
| Path                           | Method | Description                                                         |
|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *`/document-signing/sign-pdf`* | POST   | Signs an existing PDF document.                                     |
| *`/healthcheck`*               | GET    | Returns HTTP OK (`200`) to indicate a healthy application instance. |


## Integration tests warning

* If you find any `testcontainers` based tests are hanging shortly after start up, this could be caused by start up 
checks. These can be disabled by setting this value in `~/.testcontainers.properties`:

```
checks.disable=true
```

Alternatively, when running such tests, set the corresponding environment variable:

```
export TESTCONTAINERS_CHECKS_DISABLE=true
```

Other, more manageable approaches, such as setting the same value in  `src/test/resources` do not seem to work.

The issue _may_ ultimately be caused by not having the `Use gRPC FUSE for file sharing` options checked in 
Docker Desktop General Preferences, but it may also not be convenient to have this checked either.
